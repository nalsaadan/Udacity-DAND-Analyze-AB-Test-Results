# Udacity-DAND-Analyze-AB-Test-Results
This project was built as a requirement in Misk Academy-Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree.

## Overview
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these.

For this project, I have worked on an A/B test run by an e-commerce website to understand its results. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert", meaning the number of users who descide to pay for the company's product. I have worked on the notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
